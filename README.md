# NYC_Shooting_Incident_Analysis

This analysis examined NYC shooting incident data from 2006 through the prevous calendar year which for this project was 2006-2022. 
I joined it with another dataset from NYC OpenData called Projected Population 2010-2040. I used the 2020 data to get a somewhat current dataset for the NYC population.
